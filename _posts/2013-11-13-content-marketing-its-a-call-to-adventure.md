<p class="lead">Words Matter. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microstyle-The-Writing-Little-ebook">They really do</a>. As an Englishman in the US, I'm constantly aware that I'm probably being misrepresented by own vocabulary in most business, and probably social, engagements. I keep a <a href="http://bridgesandtangents.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/english1.jpg">useful guide</a> in my notebook just in case.</p>

A phrase I find disappointing (see above) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_Action">'Call to Action'</a>. 'What's the call to action?'. Never has a duller phrase revealed so truthfully the anodyne nature of most marketing efforts. It's not that you don't need one, it's just that you need more.

In the world of content marketing, or the storytelling of the purpose of a brand through social engagement, or whatever you want to call whatever it is you do all day, then a simple call to action isn't up to scratch. It's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth#The_Call_to_Adventure">Call to Adventure</a> (which is handy as you can still call it CTA and keep your briefs and spreadsheets intact).

A Call to Adventure is not about getting a momentary click from a mildly hypnotized responder. It's that moment in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth">monomyth</a>: "take my hand", "come with me if you want to live", something about heading to Mos Eisley, or dragging a ring to Mt. Doom. It is not a single, nor a solitary, event. It's the beginning of, or the continued deepening of, the belief between the customer and your value proposition - this is a journey we shall start and end together.

But we don't think like that very often because we're building something to be clicked-thru, or downloaded.

Inspire yourself about that adventure and in so doing inspire your customers. Call them to adventure and take an amazing journey together.
