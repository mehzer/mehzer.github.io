#About Angry Marketing

I'm delighted I became an engineer so I could forge a career in marketing. Every marketer should know how to code, and know their data. I spend all my time wallowing in data or creating content. Inspired by the excellent <a href="http://tomtunguz.com/">'ex post facto'</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/ttunguz">@TTunguz</a> this blog represents my blunderings through the world of technology marketing. Partly data-driven, partly opinion-driven, always angry.
